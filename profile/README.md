# Clover Dating

**Clover is a humane dating app focused on compatibility, without ads or swiping.**

---

## What is Clover?

Online dating is in shambles. The most popular apps are designed to keep you swiping, not to help you find someone. They've optimized for engagement and revenue at the expense of actually matching people.

We're building the dating app that *should* exist—one that respects your time and prioritizes compatibility.

We're inspired by what OkCupid was during its golden era (2009–2015), before the Match Group acquisition gutted everything that made it work. Deep match questions, transparent compatibility scores, and rich profiles that let you actually get to know someone before messaging them.


## Philosophy

**Humane technology.** No dark patterns, no addiction mechanics, no feature gatekeeping, no gamification designed to string you along. We respect your time and attention.

**Depth over speed.** We view swiping as a kind of evil anti-pattern. We encourage thoughtful profiles and meaningful connections.

**User agency.** Open browsing, extensive filtering, and full control over your visibility and who can contact you.

**Quality over quantity.** Message limits promote intentionality. We'd rather you send one thoughtful message than spam a hundred.


## Business Model

We're funding Clover through donations with the goal of keeping it free and open. No VCs, no investors, no one pushing us to maximize engagement at the expense of users.

**No freemium games.** We won't artificially restrict features to push you toward premium tiers. If donation funding proves unsustainable long-term, we'll introduce a minimal subscription ($3–5/month) with ways to earn free access. Either way, the goal is sustainability of a public good, not profit extraction.


## Tech Stack

**Cross-platform from day one.** Full feature parity across iOS, Android, and web—no "mobile-only" features or crippled desktop experience.

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | React Native + Expo (iOS, Android, Web) |
| Language | TypeScript (strict mode) |
| UI | React Native Paper (Material Design 3) |
| Backend | Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Realtime) |
| State | React Context + direct Supabase calls |


## Current Status

Clover is in active development. The main app is in a private repo during development — we'll share more as we get closer to launch.

We do have public repos for the current landing page, branding, and for a (so far empty, but waiting) blog.
